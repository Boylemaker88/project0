            <p class="description">As the Woodland Alliance, you work to gain the sympthay of the oppressed forest creatures. Each time you place a sympathy token on the map, you score points. The more sympathy tokens on the map
                the more points you score.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                To gain sympthay, though, you will need supporters--cards placed on your faction board--matching the clearings where you want sympathy.
                 While you can add your own cards to your supporters, you can goad your enemies into doing the same by provoking Outrange: whenever another faction removes sympathy or moves warriors into a
                 sympathetic clearing, they must add one of their own cards to your supporters.
            </p>
            <p class="description">Don't be afraid to set up chokepoints, as you are experts in Guerrilla War: when defending in battle, you use the higher die. Place your sympathy in clearings where conflict is likely,
                and force your opponent to face you!
            </p>
            <p class="description">Supporters can also be put toward violent revolt, which destroys all of your enemie' pieces in a clearing and places warriors and a new base there. Bases not only increase your card draw,
                but also let you train officers, which give you free actions each turn. Protect your bases well! If you lose a base, you'll lose many supporters and officers too.
